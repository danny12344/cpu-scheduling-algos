# Evaluating different CPU scheduling algorithms
* Experiment 1 hypothesis:
  * *The higher the CPU Burst Time the higher the average waiting time when considering the Shortest Job First (SJF with exponential averaging) algorithm*
* Experiment 2 hypothesis:
  * *There is an optimum time quantum for the Round Robin scheduler*
* Experiment 3 hypothesis:
  * *the higher the CPU Burst Time the higher the average turnaround time when considering the Round Robin scheduling algorithm.*
